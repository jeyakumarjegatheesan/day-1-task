    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP/1.1 VS HTTP/2


HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 ,
which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

HTTP/1.1                                                             HTTP/2
the usest works on the textual format.	                                It works on the binary protocol.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests             It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.	
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	     It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It compresses data by itself.	                                         It uses HPACK for data compression.
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other,                          HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of 
so if one resource cannot be loaded,                                    data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
it blocks all the other resources behind it.
